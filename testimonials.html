													<p>"I scheduled a bike fit with Marty last year shortly after purchasing my new bike. I had never had a bike fit before but several of riding buddies had and all thought it was beneficial.  Marty did a great job. He did not rush, he was though and informative.  For years I had tightness in my neck after riding.  After the fitting I do not have this issue anymore.  I gained about 10% in my speed. Marty said he would follow up with me two weeks after to make sure everything was working properly and if not we would get back together to make changes. Two weeks after he called me to make sure everything was good. It was. Best money I ever spent for my riding habit"</p>

													<p>"I am a 21-year-old cyclist out of Harrisburg PA.  I am a CAT 1 mountain bike racer but I do most of my riding and training on a road bike.  I have never gotten a bike fit before and I was considering getting a fit because I had been riding my bike more, was experiencing lower back pain, and in general, I wasn’t comfortable on the bike.  Luckily I was referred to Marty by a friend and I was able to set up my fitting appointment quite easily.  And I am glad I did because Marty did a fantastic job!  He took plenty of measurements and pictures both before and after.  I felt absolute confidence in his suggestions to alter my position and we gave each other a lot of feedback mid fit to ensure that I was certain I was comfortable on the bike.  Once I saw the after picture of myself on the bike it was incredible to see how much more aerodynamic my position was while being vastly more comfortable on the bike than before the visit.  I have been riding my bike almost two months now on the new setup and I am very pleased with how I feel!  I would definitely recommend Marty for anyone looking to get a bike fit in central PA."</p>

													<p>"Five star are not enough to describe the experience that I had at bike fit on Tuesday evening.  I heard about Bike fit from a friend.  I had been experiencing some patellar pain and knew that my bike needed some adjusting.   WOW.  Marty is very knowledgeable, extremely patient, and  incredibly precise. I so appreciated his willingness to take all the time necessary to make sure that I was comfortable and that my bike was properly fitted for my needs.  I have gone for two rides since my appointment and can already feel the difference.  I highly recommend anyone that is going to log decent mileage see Marty and make sure you are properly fitted.  Totally worth the money to prevent long term problems and heighten your enjoyment.  THANKS MARTY"</p>
