<p><strong>Pedals</strong><br>
Pedals are a common topic of conversation and different pedal systems offer different advantages and disadvantages to others.  To meet the needs of riders with various fit considerations <em>PT Bike Fit</em> keeps in stock Shimano and Look pedals as well as cleats for these road and mountain systems which are important to keep in good shape to prevent unwanted accessory movements or deviations of the pedal dynamics.<br>

	-Look Keo Max Road Pedal<br>

</p>
<strong>Superfeet Insoles</strong>
Cycling shoes and the forces applied to our foot while riding are unique. The shoe footbed is hard and flat and we put pressure through the forefoot over thousands of cycles during the ride. This pressure can be modified to improve comfort, address dysfunction/pain, and improve stability and therefore force production. Superfeet are one option to meet this goal and are now stocked in different styles to match your available shoe volume and arch type. As part of the pre-fit process, a detailed foot assessment is performed to see what is the right intervention for you.<br>
